I'm not here to perscribe the black pill, the claude pill or any other
kind of pill. I have tried many pills, and none work so good for
easing technological anxiety as post-cyber punk science fiction. The
world is changing rapidly, and this sci-fi genre has gifted me the
surprising courage to into that horizon, seeing past it, and avoid
forsaking it for either heaven or the abyss.

Stories from the post-cyberpunk genre depcit characters living in a
post singularity world, but in contrast to a cyberpunk setting, forgoe
the assumption of dystopia. In post-cyberpunk, characters have regular
lives, have regular problems, and exist amongst machines of vast power
and complexity. Such settings can typically characterized by absolute
material abundance, and the characters have the exact same problems as
you or I.

Characters in post-cyberpunk may find the concept of opt-in mortality
as mundane as we consider fast food today. Whether such advances are
good for humanity is orthogonal discussion. We see now that such
realities quiver on the horizon, possibly within our lifetimes,
whether we like it or not. Progress exhibits no caution. Remember [the
letter]() all the fancy people signed to "slow down AI progress"?
Yeah, me neither.

My experience in reading stories like Permutation City and The Culture
Series have had the effect of quelling my anxiety surrounding
technological advancement. The characters in such books live amongst
pheonomena of towering technological sophistication; infinite digital
copies, sentient drones, automatic puzzle solvers, and do so in a
remarkably casual manner.

Humans thus far have had an enuring propensity to drain the novelty
from any techonology, no matter how sublime. What the characters in
such post-cyberpunk fictions represent, is simply the continuation of
this pattern of tech normalization. Living through such perspective
vicariously is theraputic.

> It can be argued that the rise of cyberpunk fiction took place at a
time when the ‘cyber’ was still considered new, foreign, and
more-or-less strange to the average person. In this sense,
postcyberpunk essentially emerged in acknowledgement of the idea that
humanity has since adapted to the concept of cyberspace and no longer
sees some elements of cyberpunk as from a distant world.


In the player of Games, the main character lives in The Culture, a
post-scarcity, multi-world civilization. There is an infinite space of
games for humans to play, and Jernau Gurgeh is the cultures most
accomplished games player. Despite his talent and frame, Gurgeh
becomes bored with his easy life. What Jernau craves is adventure,
uncertainty, danger. The culture is omniscient and senses this, and so
it sends Jernau on a wild adventure to the Azadian system.

If I can find a fortuitous moment, when I am observing a car passing
by, a train snaking through the city, a cross-walk, a skyscraper, or
even this laptop, I can be transported back to a perspective which
observes such phenomenon with novelty and awe. It is the same
perspective which I gain second hand from reading about my
post-cyberpunk characters fururisitc enedavours. But like the
characters, admist the superlative technology, I blink, and return to
the small practical matters of my day. It doesn't matter if it's the
smartphone or the infosphere, the driverless car or the ygdrassil tree
ship, it is technology all in the same, and it's abundance can never
make the human whole.

That is why post-cyberpunk is theraputic for me, because it is a
humbling, grounding reminder that no matter how hard humanity strives,
technological abundance will never solve the fundamental problem of
being, that we don't know it's origin, purpose or final end.
Ultimately, it is the mystery of life that keeps us striving.


It is not that hard if you relax the focus of your vision and observe
the full frame of your vision. But all too often my thoughts steer
towards small and practical matters, and too goes my vision.

Add some quotes from Permuation City, The Player of Games, and make
the piece more cohesive, and we may actually have something here.
Player of Games: Discredit the brutality of the Azadian system by
publicly giving the lie to the game’s representation of social
reality. Discredit the brutality of the by publicly giving the lie to
