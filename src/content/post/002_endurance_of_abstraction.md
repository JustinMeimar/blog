OpenClaw, MoldBot, ClawdBot, whatever you call it.

Of course it is the Unix pipe.

Like the great artists whose influence endures
because they create a set of basis vectors so expansive it gives others hundreds of years of building height.

These Unix abstractions are so powerful AI swarms are being built on top of them.

Of course it is the pipe.

AIs speak text. It is the highest compression rate of information in the universe. It feels like alien technology.

The mark of great software is how long it endures.

Sure, exa-flop scale HPC has already indisputably proven the depth of the Unix file. 

But once computer use is cracked from the terminal.

Then Unix is here to stay for a long, long… really long time.
