I learned today that sites like YouTube go to great lengths to [avoid
reliable
scraping](https://nor.sanavongsay.com/blog/exploring-the-purpose-of-obfuscated-css-class-names-in-modern-web-design).
Dynamically injected content already makes scraping hard enough, I've
encountered a bunch of timing issues initiating my scraping logic
before the content is hydrated.

But even then, YouTube _rotates randomly generated class suffixes_ of
the useful divs on their site! So even if you find the class name for
a div of intererst, it might not exist the next time you load the
page. This makes it a nightmare for bots, which I understand is the
intended usecase, but it also makes my hobby extension very difficult!
