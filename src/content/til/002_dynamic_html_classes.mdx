I learned today that sites like YouTube go to great lengths to avoid
reliable scraping. Dynamically injected content makes it hard enough,
since simplying `curl`-ing the page gives a blank template. I needed
to use `playwright` to spin up the browser in a headless state and
actually navigate to the site.

But even then, YouTube _rotates randomly generated class suffixes_ of
the useful divs on their site! This means even once you find the class
name to identify a div of interest, it might not exist the next day.
This makes it a nightmare for bots - which is the intended usecase.
But it also makes my hobby extension very difficult!

How long until I just bolt a light weight VLM to transcribe the
overall vibe of the page? Hopefully before YouTube starts applying 
[adversarial filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09665) to block out bots on a pixel level.
