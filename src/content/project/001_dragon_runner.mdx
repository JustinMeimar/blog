Dragon Runner is a CLI tool used for compiler unit testing. It
takes it's name from the imfamous [Dragon Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools). Notable features
include LLVM `lit` [style answer in source](https://github.com/cmput415/Dragon-Runner?tab=readme-ov-file#test-file-format), a nice UI and clean
diffs.

The primary motivation for creating our own unit tester was to enrich
[Competitive Testing](https://cmput415.github.io/415-docs/info/testing.html) by providing a tool coupled to the tournament
rules. Dragon runner is perhaps more essential for graders than
students, who use the tool to orchestrate a tournament of executables
and test-cases fighting one another.

Originally written in the pre-agent era, `dragon-runner` is owned by
the CMPUT 415 organization. As such, I expect it to evolve rapidly as
new students become maintainers. I have tried to remain one step ahead
by vibe-coding a refector into Rust, in one-shot, with Opus 4.6.
