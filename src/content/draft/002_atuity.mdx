A semantic web filter is a tool which has prompted of my imagination recently.
The premise is, could we design some feature in a browser to filter content with
natural language? 

"Block political or news media related content."

"Limit my consumption of cat videos to a maximum of 10 minutes daily."

"Auto mute and overlay some of my favourite quotes on the screen whenever
 and advertisement appears."

 Is such a tool feasible with the current state of technology? I think so.
