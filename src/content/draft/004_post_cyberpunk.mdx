I was taking a walk today through a large field which I regularly
visit with my dog. Normally I walk around the perimiter, but today is
was completely empty, and my dog was happy to sniff around in a series
of random eliptical paths, so I did the same, following her around
like a falling leaf. I had a number of interesting thoughts, some of
which were self-referential, which are my favourite kind. Humans are
creatures of habit and our thoughts follow not far behind. It is not a
coincidence that an alternative physical path around the field had the
effect of sparking new, creative thoughts. The mind and the body are
one.

Stories from the post-cyberpunk genre depcit characters living in a
post techological-singularity world, but in contrast to a cyberpunk
setting, forgoe the assumption of dystopia. In post-cyberpunk,
characters have regular lives, exist amongst technologically advanced
machines like quantum computers or time dialators and have noramlized
conceptions of ubiquitous information spheres, digital consciousnesses
and opt-in mortality. The discussion of whether such advances are good
for humanity are a separate topic. Regardless of their moral value, we
see now that such realities quiver on the horizon, possibly within our
lifetimes. My point here to share a perspective for starting into that
horizon, and how to see past it, and the Post-Cyberpunk genre has
helped me avoid forsaking it for the abyss.

My experience in reading stories like Permutation City and The Culture
Series have had the effect of quelling my anxiety surrounding
technological advancement. The characters in such books live amongst
instances of towering technological sophistication, infinite digital
copies, sentient drones, automatic puzzle solvers, and do so in a
remarkably casual manner. Humans thus far have had an enuring
propensity towards draining the novelty from the invention and
universal adoption of technologies. What the characters in such
post-cyberpunk fictions represent, is simply the continuation of
another cycle in the pattern of technology normalization.

If find if I deliberately try, when I am observing something like a
car passing by, a train snaking through the city, a cross-walk, a
skyscraper, or even this laptop, I can be transported back to a state
which observes such phenomenon with awe. And if I blink they all snap
out of existence and I return to my small practical thoughts.

The player of Games. The main character lives in The Culture, a
post-scarcity, multi-world civilization. There is an infinite space of
games for humans to play. Jernau Gurgeh is the cultures most
accomplished games player, and becomes bored with his easy life.
Luckily for him there is an infinite hierarchy of games which can
forever test him.

— Notes From wikipedia: It can be argued that the rise of cyberpunk
fiction took place at a time when the ‘cyber’ was still considered
new, foreign, and more-or-less strange to the average person. In this
sense, postcyberpunk essentially emerged in acknowledgement of the
idea that humanity has since adapted to the concept of cyberspace and
no longer sees some elements of cyberpunk as from a distant world.“

Add some quotes from Permuation City, The Player of Games, and make
the piece more cohesive, and we may actually have something here.
Player of Games: Discredit the brutality of the Azadian system by
publicly giving the lie to the game’s representation of social
reality.
